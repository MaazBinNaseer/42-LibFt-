| 6.| Bzero| Sets everything to zero |
| 7.| Calloc| Allocates memory and sets the memory that has been allocated to zero|
| 8.| Memcmp| It checks for strings and returns the difference, it also checks for null space|
| 9.| Memcpy| Copies all the data from the **source** to the **destination** | 
|10.| Memset| Fills the block of memory or the string to a particular value |
|11.| Memmove | Moves everythin from the **source** to the **destination**, handles overlap which memcpy cannot |
|12.| Memchr | It will look for a character inside the string and returns character from that position of the character|
|13.| Strchr | Looks for a specific character inside the string and returns the string from that character position | 
|14.| Strrchr | Looks for a specific character but the last character inside that string and returns that character/string|
|15.| Strlen | Returns the string length | 
|16.| Strncmp| Compares not more than n characters. If found a difference within the n value, it will return the difference|
|17.| Strrstr| Returns the character inside the string where it last occured |
|18.| Strnstr| Looks for a string inside a source string and returns the string if found inside the source string|
|19.| Split | Splits the strings into different positions| 
|20.| Strdup | duplicates the string from the source to the destination |
|21.| Strjoin | Joins both the source and destination string into another string (malloc) |
|22.| Strlcat | Returns both the source and destination string concatination, but with restrictions | 
|23.| Strlcpy| Basically copies the source string to destination string but with a limitation of "how much to copy" |
|24.| Strtrim | Removes the string from the start and end, specified by the user| 
|25.| Substr | Subtracts the string given the parameters by the user. “We are going home” we specify where the index starting position is and we also assing n value to return that much of the string. Lets say start = 3 and n = 7, the function will return “are g” to be stored into another string(malloc) |
|26.| Atoi| Converts string to integers value |
|27.| Itoai | Converts integers to string literal |
